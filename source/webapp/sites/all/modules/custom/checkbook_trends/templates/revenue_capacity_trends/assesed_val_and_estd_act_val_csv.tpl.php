" Class One - One, two, and three family homes; single family homes on cooperatively owned land.  Condominiums with no more "
"             than three dwelling units, provided such property was previously classified as Class One or no more than three stories in height "
"             and built as condominiums. Mixed-use property with three units or less, provided 50 percent or more of the space is used for "
"             residential purposes. Vacant land, primarily residentially zoned, except in Manhattan below 110th Street."

" Class Two - All other residential property not in Class One, except hotels and motels.  Mixed-use property with four or more units,"
"             provided 50 percent or more of the space is used for residential  purposes."
