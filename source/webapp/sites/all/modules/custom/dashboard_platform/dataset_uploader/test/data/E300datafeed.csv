The LOMAS investment enables Indian Affairs to promote the economic development of tribes and individual American Indians and Alaskan Natives by providing financial assistance through guaranteed loans, insured loans, and payment of interest subsidies via a program know as the Indian Affairs Loan Guaranty, Insurance and Interest Subsidy Program.The Indian Financing Act of 1974, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, and Congressional Declaration of Policy authorized Indian Affairs to help Native Americans and Native American companies gain access to capital by guaranteeing and insuring private sector loans.  Currently, LOMAS supports economic development in Indian Country by enabling Indian Affairs to maintain information on 2,822 notes (active, currently not collectable, closed, written off, etc.) involving an original loan amount of $1,361,338,915.35 and a principal balance of $481,722,071.87 as of January 28, 2010.An unfunded LOMAS investment would cease acting to coordinate the making and servicing of loans and would cease acting to service, collect, and track the repayment of loans made by Indian Affairs.  All of the electronic processes would have to be converted to manual processes.  All participating commercial banks would have to comply with the manual process, including the transfer of information by mail or FAX with no electronic means of data transfer available.  Any prospective Native American applicants and any potential new commercial lending institutions would have to apply through a new manual process that must be developed and advertised.Initial planning for the Guaranteed Loan Accounting System (GLAS), the LOMAS Replacement investment, began in FY2009, including the purchase of ORACLE software licenses.

010-76-01-01-01-7625-00,645,Department of the Interior,Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Education,BIA - National Irrigation Information Management System (NIIMS),"NIIMS is a billing and collection system that provides complete debt management for irrigation O&M and construction accounts. The end users are Indian irrigation projects that have costs that are reimbursable by the Federal Government. The NIIMS platform is maintained at NBC in Denver under contract to the BIA Office of Trust Services (OTS). The NIIMS application is managed by staff in the Division of Water and Power (DWP), most of whom are located in Denver.  Data is entered at the project offices by BIA irrigation personnel. NIIMS satisfys requirements from a number of sources such as the Code of Federal Regulations, BIA Manuals/policies, the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, and Treasury guidelines.  NIIMS establishes receivables, tracks financial billing and collection information, processes collection actions and posts them against the receivables, and, generates summarized transactions for interfacing with FFS on a daily basis.  Bill and demand letter generation and mailings are centralized functions managed by the Denver DWP staff.  The application support staff performs debt management services including the electronic referral of delinquent debt to the U.S. Department of Treasury and proposals for debt termination.  DWP `staff handles the reconciliation of transactions among NIIMS, FFS, and Treasury, and is responsible for responding to data calls by auditors. There is currently no direct electronic connection with any other system. NIIMS also provides a number of scheduled and on-demand reports for the BIA end user and management communities. From a statute, regulatory and procedural perspective, NIIMS programs and processes require that irrigation projects comply with applicable laws and regulations.Work is underway to migrate the NIIMS functionality off of the mainframe platform and onto a modernized server-based platform.  Rising legacy mainframe costs, degradation of system capabilities due to continued use of legacy products and the difficulty in obtaining software programmers, are factors in this decision.

010-76-01-05-01-7635-00,646,Department of the Interior,Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of Indian Education,BIA - Trust Asset Accounting Management System (TAAMS),"TAAMS supports the management of trust title ownership, encumbrance, and land records through a centralized bureau-wide system. TAAMS also supports Trust Reform goals identified by DOI and BIA in the Cobell vs. Salizar case, as well as multiple strategic goals, including honoring trust responsibilities to Indian Tribes.A performance gap existed before fielding TAAMS.  The Land Title and Records Offices (LTROs) could not record title documents, e.g., deeds, leases, probates received from agencies/field offices with the speed required to certify and issue Title Status Reports (TSRs) for agencies to successfully complete trust asset transactions.  Before TAAMS, the agency offices manually created and mailed title documents to LTROs, who manually recorded, microfilmed, and entered data into the title system to maintain title documents and chain-of-title to produce TSRs and manually validate its accuracy. The agency and LTRO processes were so time- and labor-intensive that significant backlogs existed for document recording, data entry, and issuance of certified TSRs and probate inventories.TAAMS significantly reduces the amount of time needed to process documents at the agency and LTROs.  In TAAMS, title documents are created and entered at the agency and electronically delivered to LTROs via the TAAMS Image Repository where the document is recorded and processed into the land title, and then returned to the agency via the repository. TAAMS closes the gap between manual and automated delivery and processing of title documents and certified land title products and reports.  TAAMS expedites the processing of title ownership and the delivery of title documents and certified reports in minutes and hours instead of days and weeks. TAAMS is a vendor-customized COTS application operated as an Application Service Provider (ASP) that replaces several functionally-duplicative and obsolete legacy systems. It is a Mixed Life Cycle investment with both steady state portions and new components being deployed to multiple locations.This investment was reviewed by the DOI Investment Review Board (IRB) on 12/17/09.Legacy investments merged or to be merged into TAAMS include: GLADS, IRMS, LRIS, MAD, and SPRO Tracking System.",6.885,7.802,7.328,6.885,0,7.802,0,0,0,0,0,7.328,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4-Management of Government Resources,402-Financial Management,128-Asset and Liability Management,Operations and Maintenance,4,Mitigation plans have been identified and risk log needs updated.

This investment funds the support team necessary to maintain this system after deployment. BIE fielded the system with ~$7M in Dept. of Ed funding and has maintained the system with appropriations of $1.85M starting in 2008.  NASIS is now anticipated to serve BIE through 2016.  By 2013, BIE will reevaluate whether the existing system can be continued beyond 2016, or whether a replacement will be needed.BIE funds over 47,000 students in grades K-12, and indirectly serves over 400,000 students through supplemental education programs such as Johnson O'Malley and Title I programs. The BIE educational system includes 184 schools in 23 states: 118 day, 52 boarding, and 14 peripheral dormitories. BIE administers 60 schools, and over 60 different tribes operate the rest. NASIS costs much less than BIE and the Tribes each paying for their own systems, and  is providing citizens ready access to government resources through Web access to BIE status and student achievements.NASIS supports three primary functions:-School Administration to track and monitor Student Achievement, Special Education Requirements, Average Daily Attendance/Average Daily Membership, and Free and Reduced Lunch Programs, etc.-Mandated reporting including ISEP, eRATE, AYP, and No Child Left Behind (NCLB) using data captured during School Administration which facilitates information sharing between state, federal, and tribal governments.  Compared to the old manual, error-prone approach, NASIS provides greater accuracy and significantly reduces costs by eliminating duplicate data entry-Student performance improvement through analyses and longitudinal comparisons to determine the variables that affect student learningNASIS enables BIE to meet laws it could not otherwise, including Part B of Title XI of Public Law 95-561 of 1978 requires computerized MIS and NCLB Act of 2001 requires more accurate reports.NASIS is applying lessons learned from prior attempts over the past 10 years to satisfy these laws, including: -Relying upon ENAN II to connect all 187 sites to the Internet, -Involving school personnel and IT experts in vendor selection, and -Fielding a 10-person support team to assist the schools before, during, and after implementation.NASIS has been successfully implemented at all sites and is delivering the desired business results.",1.85,1.85,1.85,1.85,0,1.85,0,0,0,0,0,1.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1-Services for Citizens,106-Education,"015-Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education",Operations and Maintenance,4,"Risks are prioritized, but there are still some issues.

AFMSS core data includes leases, agreements, wells, production, approvals of operations Bond and Surety information, and operator compliance. AFMSS consists of three primary components, the AFMSS server based Internal Functionality, the tablet or notebook based Hand-held application, and the Well Information System (WIS) using eForms technology.  Interim code updating includes the updating of about 189 screens to improve the overall quality, appearance and functionality of the screens for users. A second effort (FY2009) to assess work-flow and the amount of changes in the flow of the existing applications and the extent of required modifications would have to be determined after an analysis with users. Recommendations could be provided with the type of work-flow modification for enhancing the existing application to improve efficiency.  AFMSS & WIS are critical to the BLM's implementation of the President's National Energy Policy and the Energy Policy Act of 2005.

In 2005, the Department of Interior was introducing a new enterprise-wide Financial and Business Management System (FBMS).  While the initial FBMS project scope was unclear, it was understood that some of the Bureau's financial systems would be replaced.  As such, the Management Information System/Collections and Billings System/Budget Planning System was renamed to the Collections and Billings System, as this system would be interfaced with the FBMS.  Following the BLM Managing for Excellence reorganization and the creation of the National Operations Center (NOC) in 2007, this investment will be renamed next year, to better reflect the remaining financial systems.  This coincides with the IT Systems Certification and Accreditation process in 2007, where the investment was renamed and approved as WO800 Financial Systems.   The WO800 Financial Systems consist of three Major Applications (MA), Collections and Billings System (CBS), Management Information System (MIS), and Budget and Planning System (BPS), which support thefinancial business functions and mission of the BLM.    All three systems are under the ownership of Business & Fiscal Resources and are technically and functionally supported by the BLM National Operations Center (NOC) Business Services Division located at the Denver Federal Center (DFC). Subsequent to the FBMS deployment in December 2008, the following MIS subsystems continued to operate fully: Performance & Workload Measures System, Automated Inventory Management System (AIMS), and Cost Management System (Activity Based Costing)   The Automated Fleet Management System (AFMS) continued to operate partially due to some BLM fleet requirements not currently within the scope of FBMS.  The following MIS systems will continued to operate due to the seven year requirement for the preservation and retrieval of historic data: Budget and Funds Status, Property Space Vehicles, Financial Accounting Reporting Information System, Customer Survey.  However, these systems will not be populated with new data.The CBS serves as a single standard automated system for collection and billing functions and is fully interfaced with FBMS.BPS serves as primary source used by BLM's Budget Office & WO program staffs to prepare budget & performance planning documents to be used across BLM.",2.037,2.12,2.37,2.037,0,2.12,0,0,0,0,0,2.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4-Management of Government Resources,402-Financial Management,124-Accounting,Operations and Maintenance,4,The Risk Management Plan is current and includes prioritized risks and mitigation plan.

Major functions performed are: 1. Repository Management for qualification and certification requirements related to incident response positions 2. Training Administration for class schedules, student registration , course descriptions, learning objectives, pre-course requirements, and class participation information 3. Workforce Analytics that accurately reports the disposition, status, and deficiencies of positions throughout the incident response community 4. Certification History and Currency Tracking including: positions, position performance, training, and physical fitness status The National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) sanctioned the IQCS Information Engineering Investment Study in October 20, 1999 as its guide for identifying requirements and future actions. The study found that multiple redundant systems in the Department of Interior (DOI), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the individual States created inefficiencies and difficulty in tracking Firefighter Qualifications and the dispatch of those Firefighters to incidents. Based on the findings of the Investment Study, in June 2001 NWCG chartered the IQCS Acquisition and Design phases with BLM as the lead agency.  The success of the Federal fire mission depends on the Incident Qualification and Certification System (IQCS) information. IQCS is a critical function for managing the Wildland fire program's risk, primarily in the areas of health, life safety, and legal liability.

Operation and maintenance costs remain steady at approximately $1M dollars per year, FY08-FY14. Capital Planning Investment Control (CPIC) for this investment is accomplished through Reclamation's CIO Council and Investment Review Board processes. PABS was reviewed by Investment Review Boards (IRBs) at Reclamation in March 2008, and at the Department of the Interior IRB in July 2008. Replacement of PABS by DOI's Financial Business Management System is anticipated in FY14. This Investment accomplishes Reclamation-wide budget analysis, formulation, and execution tracking in support of the President's budget as approved by Congress. PABS provides the ability to consolidate, analyze, and modify budgetary data within Regions and Area Offices as well as at the Bureau-wide level. PABS provides the Commissioner's Office with an automated tool for Funds Control management. PABS provides an interface to the accounting system, FFS, and allows for budget line item tracking/execution as it relates to BOR mission/goals. PABS plays a significant role in BOR's implementation of the Department of Interior's Activity Based Costing and Performance Management initiative. Measurement, Review and Approval Process:  PABS performance is annually evaluated by BOR. Funding is reviewed and approved annually by both the DOI IRB and BOR's CFO Council. PABS is Certified and Accredited, and included in regularly scheduled Internal Control Reviews (ICRs), and Departmental Functional Reviews (DFRs).

RMSS is a Major (Exhibit 300) steady-state IT Portfolio investment; no major development/modernization/enhancement (DME) acquisitions or contracts are planned. All operational, maintenance and life-cycle management expenses of the various system components and services are treated as operations and maintenance (O&M) costs.  Reclamation is responsible for over 75 percent of all constructed assets of the Water Resource Management (WRM) line of business activity in the Department of the Interior (DOI). Management of water resources occurs within a complex legal framework of general law and authorities currently incorporating more than 5,000 pages of congressional direction. RMSS is the foundation for Reclamation mission-related WRM-focused work functions and a large number of other Reclamation IT Portfolio Investments (Major & Non-Major) that compute, store, access, maintain, and back up user-generated, mission-specific data for a  wide range of functional activities related to water and hydroelectric power management objectives, including planning, environmental programs, and administrative functions. To accomplish these WRM goals and objectives, Reclamation personnel need ready access to both current and historical data. They must analyze and summarize data, complete essential operational activities, as well as prepare reports and presentations which provide meaningful information to citizens, business partners, and other government entities. To achieve these ends, the work force relies upon the capabilities of modern IT. RMSS is the WRM-tailored IT system consisting of services, functionalities and IT operations personnel that support the secure, reliable data repositories, data analysis, reporting capabilities, transactions and collaborative tools for Reclamation personnel to perform their work. RMSS also includes the secure network perimeter that protects water management automation tools and services so authorized individuals can securely perform Reclamations' business functions and work activities to successfully carry out the mission.",40.702,41.726,42.511,40.702,0,41.726,0,8.543,5.907,4.599,3.169,20.293,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1-Services for Citizens,117-Natural Resources,056-Water Resource Management,Operations and Maintenance,5,"Mitigation plans are in place to address outstanding risks and these plans are tracked.

010-12-01-05-01-1201-00,657,Department of the Interior,United States Geological Survey,USGS - Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS),"The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) is the USGS initiative to broadly improve the monitoring and reporting of earthquakes in the U.S., reducing economic losses and fatalities and improving the Nation's resilience to earthquakes.Begun in 2000, ANSS is modernizing and expanding capabilities nationally by establishing an integrated national system of 7100 sensors, providing data to national and regional centers. ANSS provides realtime information on the distribution and intensity of earthquake shaking to emergency responders so that they can rapidly assess the full impact of an earthquake and speed disaster relief to the most heavily affected areas. ANSS also provides engineers with the information they need to improve building design standards and engineering practices to mitigate the impact of earthquakes.ANSS reduces costs through avoided losses. Average annual earthquake losses in the U.S. are estimated to approach $6 billion per year. Losses are avoided by improved mitigation (a result of more accurate hazard assessments), improved emergency response (a result of more accurate, useful and timely information), and improved awareness and decision-making in both public and private sectors (a result of the availability of accurate, reliable, timely information).As detailed in a report of the National Academy, strongly supporting the full deployment of ANSS, the beneficiaries are diverse: the public benefits from improved earthquake safety and reduced losses; emergency responders, governments at all levels, and lifeline operators benefit from improved situational awareness following a damaging earthquake; and scientists, engineers and architects benefit from improved data and information about earthquakes and the ground- and structural motions they cause.The 2008 USGS Science Strategy Report calls for Full deployment of the [ANSS] to improve seismic monitoring of the Nation and the 26 U.S. urban areas at greatest risk from earthquakes. ANSS is also a top priority of the NEHRP Strategic Plan and in the Grand Challenges for Disaster Reduction Implementation Plan of the NSTC Subcommittee for Disaster Reduction. Its full implementation is a top recommendation of the Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee, the FACA advisory committee to the USGS Director for the Earthquake Hazards Program.In 2009, ANSS received $30M in ARRA funds to upgrade legacy stations and networks.

010-12-01-07-01-3004-00,658,Department of the Interior,United States Geological Survey,USGS - Enterprise Web (EWEB),"Enterprise Web (EWeb) is the public face of USGS for millions who rely on the Internet as a primary source for science news and information. EWeb hosts websites that deliver science to over 21 million unique USGS website visitors, including 452 million web pages and 356 gigabytes of data annually.  EWeb aligns with the USGS science strategy and supports the DOI Open Government initiative and IT transformation. EWeb excels in investment management and keeps all project documentation current.   EWeb is the public delivery mechanism for USGS science, enabling the DOI Strategic Plan, which integrates science into decision making and recognizes its essential role in natural, energy and cultural resource management and sustainability. EWeb provides web services to all USGS programs for their delivery of USGS science over 850 websites, complying with Federal and Departmental requirements. Services include compliance screening, secure website hosting and data storage, surge delivery during peak use (e.g., disasters), search, web metrics, website registration, Data.gov submissions, consulting services for website and application development, training and best practices. Activities include management and governance, operation of centrally managed infrastructure, and re-engineering of USGS web presence.  EWeb infrastructure consists of a consolidated, virtualized architecture, featuring geographically distributed, load balanced, failure-resistant servers with volume surge protection. EWeb architecture uses existing proven technologies, industry best practices, COTS solutions, service contracts, performance monitoring and redundancy to ensure availability and performance. EWeb complies with security and all Federal requirements. To manage other risks, EWeb launches pilots, change management, earned value management, spending plan tools and coordination with the DOI Web Council.   EWeb services support other USGS major CPIC investments, including ANSS (Earthquakes), National Biological Information Infrastructure, and the National Water Information Systems. EWeb infrastructure enables uninterrupted delivery earthquake information. When Canadian websites went dark and the government wasn't providing any information on the quake, the media turned to USGS for information and obtained it without a hitch (OTTAWA CITIZEN, Nov 28, 2010).

010-12-01-02-01-1206-00,664,Department of the Interior,United States Geological Survey,USGS - National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII),"The NBII is a unique Federal resource that embodies the Administration's concept of OPEN GOVERNMENT. It provides transparency for data generated by the Federal government, both directly and as a contributor to DATA.GOV, and it responds to A-130 by making Federal data and information available and useful to the government and to the public. In addition, the NBII provides access to high quality natural resources data, information, and tools produced by credible scientific organizations from all sectors. This is critical since systems designed to provide access to the data of a single organization expose only that organization's perspective of an issue. However, scientists, resource managers, decision makers and others often need access to a broader array of data on a given topic to formulate the most complete picture possible of the latest state of the resource or challenge they are addressing. This makes NBII a unique system in the Federal government, excelling at filling a gap not being filled elsewhere.In 1987, the natural resources community described an urgent need for access to the vast body of existing natural resource data to address environmental challenges in a published report. This need was confirmed in 1993 with the National Research Council's publication of A Biological Survey for the Nation, which charged DOI with creating a national system to address this need. The NBII was created in response to this charge. In 1998, a White House panel of experts published a report called Teaming with Life,  which, in part, commended NBII for its work in developing, promoting and implementing national and global data/information documentation and exchange standards, and also issued direction for the next decade.Today, the NBII provides access to millions of units of natural resources data and information and dozens of tools, applications, models, and visualizations for interacting with data, making it more useful than ever before. The NBII's mission is directly aligned with the DOI Strategic Plan objective of providing the scientific foundation for decision-making and creating the science and information framework for understanding the Earth. It is therefore not surprising that more than 3 million customers used the NBII to download nearly a terabyte of data per month in 2010, and consider the NBII to be a trusted partner in identifying high quality, relevant data sources, many of which are unavailable elsewhere.",3.537,3.537,2.359,3.537,0,3.537,0,0,0,0,0,2.359,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1-Services for Citizens,108-Environmental Management,023-Environmental Monitoring and Forecasting,Operations and Maintenance,4,Security related risks are captured in POAMS.

The National Water Information System (NWIS) is both a work-flow application and a long-term database for National records of ground-water quality and levels; surface-water quality, flow, stage and discharge; therefore, NWIS must be managed and maintained as a National archive of data. USGS personnel use NWIS for the collection, acquisition, processing, review, storage, and dissemination of data. Data quickly and easily available from NWIS are essential to the implementation and successful completion of a broad range of interpretive studies addressing ground-water, surface-water, water-quality, and water-use issues that are critical to USGS partners in local, State, tribal, and Federal government. For example, the hydrologic data stored and made available by NWIS are used not only for determining the adequacy of water supplies, but also for implementing flood-warning systems; designing dams, bridges, and flood control projects; allocating irrigation water; locating sources of pollution; planning for energy development; and investigating the contamination potential of water supplies due to natural and human influences. NWIS' real-time data processing features enable data transmitted via satellite or other telemetry to be processed, screened for outliers, and made publicly available 5-10 minutes after transmission. The continued support and maintenance of the NWIS will improve USGS performance in support of the Resource Protection Outcome Goal - Improve the Understanding of National Ecosystems and Resources Through Integrated Interdisciplinary Assessment - in the DOI Strategic Plan. Land and resource managers will have improved access and use of USGS hydrologic/water data for informed decision making. Maintenance improvements to NWIS will increase the amount and type of water data and related metadata available to customers, including more information about the quality of the data. Maintenance improvements made to the NWIS applications and interfaces to other agencies will increase customer satisfaction in the areas of ease, speed, and effectiveness of data access and data integration.

010-12-01-02-01-1210-00,667,Department of the Interior,United States Geological Survey,USGS - The National Map Reengineering Project,"For over 125 years, the USGS has had a mandate to provide base topographic information to the Nation, to its own scientific programs, and those of other Federal agencies. The mission is consistent with the OMB Circular A-16, Coordination of Surveying, Mapping, and Related Spatial Data Activities. A-16 requires the USGS to lead the Nation in providing and maintaining a common set of base information and to be the Federal agency leader for elevation, hydrography, orthoimagery, and geographic names. The USGS is providing the national leadership to organize, maintain, publish, and disseminate The National Map, a set of basic geospatial information provided as a variety of products and services. This re-engineering project incorporates the IT efforts required to move to a more efficient and automated capability for meeting this mission. The investment includes the systems for data ingest, integration, production, and distribution for digital Geographic Information System (GIS) data, and updated, printable topographic maps (US Topos). These system improvements enable the automation of map production to meet the goal of producing updated US Topo maps for the CONUS on a three-year cycle. It took ~ 3,000 people over 55 years to do a once over complete coverage of the continental US. Now it is being updated every 3 years by about 300 people through the use of enhanced system automation processes.TNM supports National Critical Infrastructure assets by being the (1) guarantor of national data completeness, consistency, and accuracy, (2) catalyst and collaborator for creating and stimulating partnerships, (3) integrator and certifier of basic geospatial data from other participants, (4) owner and data producer of content for The National Map when no other suitable and verifiable source for those data exists, and (5) leader in the development and implementation of national geospatial data standards. The Mapping Sciences Committee of the National Research Council conducted an in-depth independent review of The National Map concept (Weaving a National Map, The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2003).

IMARS will provide a common capability across all participating functional areas for capturing and reporting law enforcement and security incident information and will be configured, tested, and deployed to over 6,000 users in FY12. IMARS will be deployed across all agencies and locations to addresses three principle threats:   National Security - Law enforcement officers (LEOs) and agents working in seven law enforcement programs distributed between five bureaus nationwide lack the tools to perform various law enforcement activities (information sharing and intelligence analysis of terrorism, drug cartels, etc.) which take place in the nations 1,672 sites and to protect 489 million visitors annually.  Because DOI has so many law enforcement responsibilities at so many sites across the country, it is continually collecting information on people and events.  Both actions and observations, criminal and non-criminal, may have security implications, and these need to be recorded, reported, shared and analyzed on multiple levels.   Public Safety - DOI, the nations largest land-owner, has day-to-day law enforcement responsibilities on 500 million acres of lands that it owns and manages.  DOI has the responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate criminal activity that occurs on its lands.  DOI must manage safety and protection for the millions of visitors each year that use these lands, as well as for the thousands of DOI employees that manage the resources, including monitor visitor use, manage crowds/traffic, and protect natural and cultural resources.  These responsibilities require the collection, analysis, management and reporting of information.   Officer Safety - DOI LEOs, including corrections and investigations (appr. 6,500 ), are at a far greater risk due to a lack of informaiton sharing on warrants and suspected individuals. IMARS access will allow officers (including tribal), agents, and dispatchers to access departmental and national databases from their immediate locations, thus significantly enhancing officer safety in the field.IMARS will conduct a Post Implementation Review in FY13 and track performance through Operational Analysis.

The Secretary of Interior established the Office of Historical Trust Accounting (OHTA) in July 2001. OHTA's mission is to perform the historical accounting of IIM accounts and verify their accuracy.Since its inception in 2001, OHTA's scope has expanded to include Tribal accountings, related to the approximately 100 active lawsuits filed by Tribes against Interior. OHTA provides litigation support to Interior, participates in settlement negotiations with tribes, and performs a historical accounting where necessary to support Court actions or settlement.To assist historical accounting efforts, OHTA developed a common Accounting Reconciliation Tool (ART). ART provides a standard and repeatable process for accountants to query transactions from legacy systems, link transactions to relevant source documents, and reconcile transactions and note discrepancies. In addition, the ART includes functionality that assists OHTA in performing quality control and monitoring of reconciliation activities. Data from ART is used to prepare the Historical Statements of Account, which fulfills Interior's requirement to provide a historical accounting.The Secretary has placed a priority on funding the historical accounting to support Cobell and Tribal lawsuits. OHTA senior management allocates the Office funding and ensures the necessary ART funding is provided. If the ART is not funded and is shut down, then Interior cannot comply with the Court's mandate to provide a historical accounting. This could lead to further court action, such as contempt of court citations, or other consequences for Interior.The ART addresses the Serving Communities mission area in Interior's Strategic Plan and allows Interior to achieve the End Outcome Goal to Fulfill Indian Fiduciary Trust Responsibilities. Specifically, the ART enables Interior to comply with the Court ordered historical accounting and the Trust Funds Management Reform Act of 1994 (to account for the daily and annual balances of all funds held in trust by the US for the benefit of an Indian Tribe or an Individual, which are deposited or invested pursuant to the Act of June 24, 1938).",3.195,3.263,3.263,3.195,0,3.263,0,0.105,0.035,0.077,1.147,1.899,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3-Support Delivery of Services to Citizens,301-Controls and Oversight,093-Program Monitoring,Operations and Maintenance,5,The ART investment is in a Steady State.

The three systems were the Fee Billing and Collection System (FEEBACS), Audit Fee Billing and Collection System (AFBACS), and Civil Penalty and Collection System (CPACS). All three of the legacy systems supported various aspects of OSM's fee compliance program and/or the civil penalty enforcement program. The fee compliance program is a mission critical program in OSM. The program collects over $272 million a year in reclamation fees that are deposited into the Abandoned Mine Land Fund. The fee compliance program is highly successful, with a 99% collection rate and a 94% on-time reporting rate from coal companies. This investment is necessary to maintain the high quality of program performance and efficiency. The new system is built on a COTS platform and complies with the Departmental architecture, making it easier and less costly to maintain than the three legacy systems.  Planned operating efficiencies were also realized.  The final implementation of CFCMS will address POAM items identified by KPMG auditors.

Estimates are that the Federal Government alone invests greater than $6.0 billion each year (FY04 estimate from the National Research Council) in geospatial data and that duplication is common, but currently impossible to quantify. In line with the E-government mission to improve the delivery of services through technology, Geospatial One-Stop takes advantage of geospatial data and technologies developed and maintained by thousands of Federal, state, local, and tribal agencies and private sector organizations across the country and provides easy access to place-based government assets through an Internet Portal (http://gos2.geodata.gov). GOS continues to support the current adminstration's Openness in Government initiative through collaboration with Data.gov.The investment enables Federal agencies to publish metatdata about their geospatial data holdings into the Geospatial One-Stop Portal so that all other government agencies may discover and share geospatial resources, rather than invest in purchasing new, and possibly redundant, data sets. These geospatial resources include not only Federal data but also state and local government data so that cost savings can be realized through sharing of data among all government agencies.  In addition, users can find others interested in future investments in the same area through the portal, providing for potential partnerships and collaboration for geospatial data acquisition.This initiative enables Federal agencies to more effectively leverage their financial resources in support of mission goals that require geospatial data to achieve success.  Geospatial One-Stop is currently in a 'steady state' phase, closely linked to the goals of Data.gov, Geospatial Line of Business, Open Government  and is looking to leverage our Federal geospatial financial resources to build common, shared map services and datasets to be used across government.

This standardization provides cost avoidance to DOI through economies of scale; it reduces/eliminates duplicate processes and streamlines HR processes. Most Exhibits show only IT project costs, but HRLOB shows all LOB costs, to meet OPM requirements.To fulfill OPM commitments, NBC continues to expand its current services by delivering a standardized, integrated HR Information System that supports the strategic management of human capital. FPPS provides OPM's three core HR services (Compensation Management, Benefits Management, and BRM activities resulting in a Personnel Action) to more than 40 federal agencies. NBC also offers a modern data warehouse for purposes of reports and data analysis. NBC has enhanced its FPPS services by expanding its non-core systems offerings that includes an integration framework enabling real-time interoperability between FPPS and other systems: Entrance On Duty (EODS); Talent Management (TMS); Workforce Transformation and Tracking (WTTS), and Electronic Official Personnel File (eOPF). WTTS and EODS are integrated real time with FPPS and with automated staffing systems (Monster Government Solution's Enterprise Hiring Manager (EHM) and OPM's USA Staffing (USAS)). NBC offers customers EHM and USAS licensing discounts. (Some customers receive a discount of more than 50% of what they could attain on their own.)HRLOB directly supports DOI's Strategic Human Capital Management Plan. Consolidation of DOI HR services provides cost avoidance and econonomies of scale, keeping DOI's W-2 costs steady (currently about the same as it was in 1993!)

In addition, ONRR serves as a trustee of the royalty asset from Indian trust properties and as an advocate for the interests of Indian mineral owners, ensuring fulfillment of our Indian trust responsibility. The MRMSS is critical to ONRR s ability to account for, and disburse mineral revenues in a timely fashion to Treasury, states, American Indians, and other agencies. Total revenues accounted for and disbursed during FY 2010 were approximately $9.2 billion. Three primary IT subsystems of the MRMSS that are vital to the accomplishment of the ONRR mission are: 1-The Financial subsystem, which accounts for and distributes the billions of dollars that the government collects from energy companies for both conventional energy and renewable energy on Federal and Indian lands.  2-The Data Warehouse subsystem, which maintains historical information from mineral revenues, oil and gas leases, and includes specialized tools for verifying companies  compliance with laws, lease terms and regulations.  3-The Asset Management subsystem, which uses a suite of tailored COTS applications that are integrated with the Financial Management and Data Warehouse subsystems, and is responsible for economic analysis and managing royalties received in kind.  MRMSS current table-driven methodology is effective; however, recent changes in laws have required ONRR to deploy new lease-specific disbursements requiring offline manual processing.

POSS will integrate with Treasury Financial Management and credit card systems and DOI financial systems for deposit, accounting, and reconciliation of fees.The system was chartered to allow NPS to better comply with OMB Circular A-123 (Management's Responsibility for Internal Control), requirements of A-130 (Management of Federal Information Resources), FISMA IT security mandates, and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. The system also addresses 2 DOI Strategic Goals:  Management Excellence: Improved Financial Management, and Advance Modernization/Integration. NPS collected over $179M in FY07 in recreation fee revenues at 256 sites, up to $185M in FY10. Of the 256 NPS units that collected fees in FY07, 56 (62% of total fee revenues) used some sort of POS computer or cash register which captured and stored transactions. The remaining parks were using various other fee-collection methods without automated record keeping, data collection or reporting.  Before POSS, NPS had no standard for fee collection; each park independently developed or procured its own solution, and maintains responsibility for the contracting vehicles (primarily sole-source) for the installation, and maintenance of the equipment and software. This situation requires significant and continuous effort in maintaining compliance with internal control policies, and makes compliance with FISMA IT Security requirements nearly impossible. POSS addresses these challenges by providing parks with a standardized vehicle with which they can procure POS terminal hardware, software, training, and installation services, as park needs and budgets allow.POSS has a 10+ year life cycle.

The GCPO SCADA system is nearing the end of its useful life cycle and needs to be replaced before critical operations are jeopardized. Replacement of the current system included thorough alternatives analyses (AA). An RFP along with system specifications was released in 2006 to solicit input from outside parties. The RFP was cancelled because technical & modular requirements for key components either could not be addressed without the use of proprietary platforms or would require a greater than expected investment (>$40-60 million). In 2008, USBR investigated the US Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) SCADA system or the Generic Data Acquisition and Control (GDAC) System. The GDAC solution promoted standardization of SCADA and other devices in water & power facilities located across the Columbia River/NW and the use of modular devices, which allowed for the incremental deployment of RTUs, the ability to swap-out devices when upgrading equipment, & ongoing ACE maintenance of the system.

FMSS is an asset-based work identification, planning, management, and analysis program. It contains the entire NPS inventory data universe of more than 70,000 assets and over 1.6 million work orders used by NPS units to track and manage work. This cradle to grave asset and work management system allows a park, region or Washington Area Support Office (WASO) to track all aspects of work related to a specific asset; such as planning and design, construction, operations/maintenance, rehabilitation and removal. The enterprise system has approximately 36 interrelated systems and applications. The core component of FMSS is a customized version of the IBM Maximo software product; the requirements stated for the EFMSS include the IT costs associated with the core applications and the additional cost to facilitate the interface between the core system and corrollary sytstems (but not the cost to run the corrallary systems and programs in their entirity).  Examples of the associated applications and systems include Maximo, Citrix, Project Management Information System, Cost Estimating Software System, Web CRV Calculator, Asset Management Report System, Condition Assessment Website, and Asset Priority Index. This investment allows the NPS to implement a systematic process to identify, prioritize and manage the backlog of maintenance tasks and to measure the overall change in asset conditions based upon work accomplished or deferred. The increased speed and efficiency in data collection and information dissemination allows the NPS to better plan and prioritize work, document the utilization of resources, measure and evaluate results, and identify report needs, progress and accomplishments. FMSS's utilization of a centralized database and web based system generates significant time and cost savings in system administration, data gathering, quality assurance, and information sharing.  This investment is currently in a steady state having been in use since the 2000/2001 timeframe.

Effective January 1, 2011, the OCS Connect deployed functionalities were integrated into TIMS: Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) and Notice of Sale (NOS).  In addition, BOEMRE has begun the process of upgrading TIMS to meet business requirements and address performance concerns by leveraging more current, web based, and user-friendly technologies.  The BOEMRE is undergoing a complete reorganization, as outlined by the Secretary of DOI.  During this reorganization, TIMS will be analyzed to determine changes and upgrades necessary to support the new organizations and their new mission requirements.  These requirements will include new responsibilities and will result from numerous external reviews and reports.The BOEMRE (MMS) mission is to manage the minerals resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to enhance public and trust benefit, promote responsible use, and realize fair value.  The leasing of Federal Lands, development activities, and demand for oil and gas has increased the need of better data for BOEMRE managers to make strategic decision.  To do this, BOEMRE designed and developed the Technical Information Management System (TIMS).  The TIMS was designed to collect reporting requirements and to analyze report and map information to provide BOEMRE management with the array of information necessary to carry out the BOEMRE mission.   The TIMS was built on an integrated corporate database which provided the foundation to all the applications.

They further stated that the information is sometimes difficult to access, and some of the data are unreliable.   This report recommends that,  IT systems should be considered within the context of the BOEMRE reorganization. Specifically, BOEMRE should examine whether TIMS can be upgraded to meet business requirements and address user performance concerns by leveraging more current, web based, user-friendly technologies together with existing tools already within the Department. BOEMRE should carefully consider factors such as speed, performance requirements, and cost-effectiveness.
