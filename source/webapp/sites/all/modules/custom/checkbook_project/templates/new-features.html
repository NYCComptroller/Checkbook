<div class="new-features-title">Sub vendor Contracts Status in Checkbook</div>
<div class="new-features-description">
    <p>
       It is our wish to not only provide greater transparency, but to help prime and sub vendors track the progress of their sub-contracts within the City. In order to achieve this, we needed to provide Agency Chief Contracting Officers (ACCOs) with a simple way to review all of their prime contracts while encouraging more Prime vendors to enter their sub vendor information into the City’s Payment Information Portal. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>By including additional subcontractor information into Checkbook we are now able to allow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1) All interested parties outside of City government to review sub vendor information, including contracts and payments.</li>
        <li>2) Prime vendors and ACCOs to see who has declared and entered sub vendor information on prime contracts into PIP as required by MOCS.</li>
        <li>3) Prime vendors a simple way to review the status of all their contracts. </li>
        <li>4) Sub vendors to cross-reference information entered in PIP to their own accounts payable systems to ensure proper, prompt payment.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3 class="new-features">WHAT NEW INFORMATION IS BEING ADDED TO CHECKBOOK?</h3>
<div class="new-features-title">1.  Prime Vendor Contract Status</div>
<div class="new-features-description">

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>1 = No Data Entered. Prime has not entered any sub vendor information</li>
        <li>2 = Yes. Prime has indicated sub vendors on contract</li>

            <li>3 = Reviewing- Waiting for ACCO to approve or reject sub vendor contract </li>
            <li>4 = Approved - ACCO approved sub vendor contract</li>

            <li><strong>No Subcontract Information Submitted by Prime</strong>- This status indicates that the prime has not submitted subcontract information for approval.</li>
            <li><strong>No Subcontract Payments submitted by Prime</strong>-This status indicates that the prime has said yes to sub vendors and ACCO has approved the sub vendor but there are no payments submitted by prime for the sub vendor.</li>

    <div class="new-features-description">
        <p>The new content is shared using newly built checkbook widgets. Within the Contract Landing pages, a new field called <strong>‘Contract Includes Sub vendors’</strong> has been added to the widget table.  For each prime vendor contract, one of three values is displayed: No Data Entered, Yes or No.  (See Figures 1 and 2).
    For prime contract records active prior to FY2016, this new field shall display status as <strong>'Prior Year Exclusions'</strong>.

        <p>Three new widget tables have been created at the City-wide Level, Agency Level and Vendor Level to report the status of sub vendor contracts entered into PIP by the prime vendor. This is a visual representation of the data we’ll now be providing. </p>

    <div class="new-features-description">
        <p>Transaction pages have been updated to now include all of the information that we have pertaining to contracts.

Additionally, the ‘Narrow Down Your Search’ filters now allow users to filter on the sub vendor’s status in the Payment Information Portal (PIP) and on whether the “By Contract Includes Sub vendors’’, allowing the user to know if the Prime Vendor has declared sub vendors on a contract.
