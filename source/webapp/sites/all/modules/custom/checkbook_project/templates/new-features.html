<h4 class="feature-title">1. Sub vendor Contracts Status</h4>
<!--<div class="new-features-title">Sub vendor Contracts Status in Checkbook</div> -->
<div class="new-features-description">
  <p>
    It is our wish to not only provide greater transparency, but to help prime and sub vendors track the progress of their sub-contracts within the City. In order to achieve this, we needed to provide Agency Chief Contracting Officers (ACCOs) with a simple way to review all of their prime contracts while encouraging more Prime vendors to enter their sub vendor information into the City’s Payment Information Portal.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>By including additional subcontractor information into Checkbook, we are now able to allow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1) All interested parties to review sub vendor information, including contracts and payments.</li>
    <li>2) Interested parties to see who has declared and entered sub vendor information on prime contracts into PIP as required by MOCS.</li>
    <li>3) Prime vendors a simple way to review the status of all their contracts. </li>
    <li>4) Sub vendors to cross-reference information entered in PIP to their own accounts payable systems to ensure proper, prompt payment.</li>
  </ul>
