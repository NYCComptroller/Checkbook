TCPDF support:
  TCPDF's support for CSS is considerably worse than the other tools.
  Unicode is supported (use of Unicode fonts result in HUGE files).  Page
  header and footer are supported. This module requires TCPDF >= 5.9.012.

  1. Download TCPDF from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcpdf/
  2. Extract the contents of the downloaded package into one of the
  supported paths.  There is no need to modify the config/tcpdf_config.php
  file, as the module self-configures TCPDF.
  3. Grant write access to the cache and images directories to your
  webserver user.
  4. Check http://tcpdf.sourceforge.net/ for further information.
