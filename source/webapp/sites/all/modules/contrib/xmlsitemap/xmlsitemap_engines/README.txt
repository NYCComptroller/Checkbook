INTRODUCTION
------------

The XML sitemap engines module, part of the XML sitemap
(https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap) package, uploads the sitemap to
search engines automatically. The XML sitemap module creates a sitemap that
conforms to the sitemaps.org specification. This helps search engines to more
intelligently crawl a website and keep their results up to date.
