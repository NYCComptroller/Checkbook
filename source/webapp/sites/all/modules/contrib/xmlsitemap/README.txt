INTRODUCTION
------------

XML Sitemap automatically creates a sitemap that conforms to the sitemaps.org
specification. This helps search engines keep their search results up to date.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

No special requirements


INSTALLATION
------------

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7 for further
information.

Once XML Sitemap is installed and enabled, you can adjust the settings for your
site's sitemap at admin/config/search/xmlsitemap. Your can view your site's
sitemap at http://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml.

It is highly recommended that you have clean URLs enabled for this project.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * Configure your XML sitemap in:
   Configuration » Search and metadata »XML sitemap

   - Check your XML site
   - Click in Update for update the XML values.


UNINSTALLING
------------

Because Drupal does not uninstall modules in reverse order of their
dependencies, if you want to uninstall all the XML sitemap modules, be sure to
disable and uninstall all the sub-modules before the base XML sitemap module.
