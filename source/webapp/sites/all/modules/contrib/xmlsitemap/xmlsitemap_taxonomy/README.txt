INTRODUCTION
------------

The XML sitemap taxonomy module, part of the XML sitemap
(https://www.drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap) package, adds taxonomy term links
to the sitemap. The XML sitemap module creates a sitemap that conforms to the
sitemaps.org specification. This helps search engines to more intelligently
crawl a website and keep their results up to date.
