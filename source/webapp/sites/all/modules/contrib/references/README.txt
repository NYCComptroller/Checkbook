-- SUMMARY --

The References project contains straight ports of the node_reference and 
user_reference modules to the Drupal 7 API.

For a full description of the module, visit the project page:
  http://drupal.org/project/references
  
-- REQUIREMENTS --

None. 

CCK for Drupal 7 is /not/ a requirement for these modules.

-- GOALS AND LIMITATIONS -- 
  
It is not envisioned as a final solution, but as a way to actually deploy 
Drupal 7 from release day on sites using node and user references much as on 
Drupal 6, until a native entity relationships Drupal 7 module becomes a usable 
alternative.

As of 2010-11-30, is looks like a candidate for that usable alternative might
someday be project Relation: 
  http://drupal.org/project/relation

In short: use these modules now, but be ready to migrate to a different entity
referencing solution during the D7 life cycle.
