     <p>(a) 	The summonses issued by various City agencies for parking violations are adjudicated and collected by the Parking Violations Bureau (PVB) of the City's Department of Finance.</p>
     <p>(b) 	Proposed "write-offs" are in accordance with a write-off policy implemented by PVB for summonses determined to be legally uncollectible/unprocessable or for which all prescribed collection efforts are unsuccessful.</p>
     <p>(c) 	The Allowance for Uncollectible Amounts is calculated as follows: summonses which are over three years old are fully (100%) reserved and 35% of summonses less than three years old are reserved.</p>
     <p>Note: Data does not include interest reflected on the books of PVB.</p>
