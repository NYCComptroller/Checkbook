# System Requirements 

Apache Solr runs of Java 6 or greater. When using Java 7, be sure to 
install at least Update 1! With all Java versions it is strongly 
recommended to not use experimental `-XX` JVM options. It is also 
recommended to always use the latest update version of your Java VM, 
because bugs may affect Solr. An overview of known JVM bugs can be 
found on http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/SunJavaBugs. 

CPU, disk and memory requirements are based on the many choices made in 
implementing Solr (document size, number of documents, and number of 
hits retrieved to name a few). The benchmarks page has some information 
related to performance on particular platforms. 

*To build Apache Solr from source, refer to the `BUILD.txt` file in 
the distribution directory.*
